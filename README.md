# Subscription

##Payment

###Flow #1

 1. Register user (email, password, submit button)
 1. Activation Link sent to email
 1. Click activation link, user directed to payment platform
 1.	After successful payment, direct user to the app homepage 
 
###Flow #2 

 1. Register user (email, password, 'create new account' button). Below it is enter payment information. 
 2. When user clicks submit, it "auto" logs in user and takes them to the app homepage. 
 
##Important UX Ideas

* Leave activation for later. **Don't delay their payment**. If they want to pay, let them pay now. Take away the stumbling blocks. Activation can happen after-the-fact.

* Explain to user the key benefits of paying now: Guaranteed seating, locked-in price, etc. Convince the user this is a great time to pay now.

  * Make it easy to switch from login to signup and vice versa

  * Make signup a seperate process than login. Some put it both on the same page. But makes the page too complicated.
  
  * Use "icons" rather than "text" to show your sign-up form is **secure**
  
  * Best practices for premium sign-up
